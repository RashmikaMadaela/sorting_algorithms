## Algorithms Included

The following sorting algorithms are included:

* Bubble Sort
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Quick Sort
* Merge Sort

## File Structure

For clarity, it's recommended to place each algorithm in its own file within a `sorting` directory. A `main.py` file can then be used to import and test the functions.
